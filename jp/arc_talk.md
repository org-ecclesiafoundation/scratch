We find ourselves in the midst of
0:02
a so-called culture war. It's
0:07
a psychological and
0:11
social
0:13
mindfield. And at this conference we'd be
0:17
trying to weave our
0:18
way through that minefield and to offer
0:24
something approximating
0:25
a solution
0:28
that beckons,
0:31
and is productive and
0:37
generous. I want to investigate though a
0:39
little further; I want to investigate the
0:43
essential feature of that war a
0:45
little further, and while doing so I want
0:48
to wind together--weave together--the
0:51
themes of the
0:53
conference. We're at odds with one
0:55
another about
0:58
identity. And in order
1:03
to reduce the tension and bring
1:07
about a new psychological integration
1:10
and a proper social peace we can't
1:14
merely
1:15
criticize the suggestions about what
1:17
identity constitutes that have been
1:19
brought forward. We have to offer an
1:22
alternative. And so I would like to delve
1:26
deeply for half an hour
1:28
into what
1:31
identity must and should
1:34
be and to relate that to what social
1:40
structure must and should
1:43
be I opened the conference by pointing
1:47
out proposing that the two fundamental
1:52
themes that we would address would be
1:53
those of faith and responsibility and I
1:56
suggested
1:58
that faith is a faith is the kind of
2:02
Courage that allows you to welcome the
2:05
possibilities of the future with open
2:07
arms and and I say possibility because
2:11
the future is the manifestation of
2:13
possibility into actuality and the
2:16
possibility of the future is what we
2:18
contend with the the
2:21
unknown Treasure House of what could be
2:24
is what we contend with and given that
2:27
that's what we eternally contend with we
2:30
might ask ourselves how best to contend
2:33
with that and one answer to that is with
2:36
the faith that is simultaneously
2:38
courageous we put ourselves on the line
2:41
to act out the proposition that
2:44
existence itself being itself and
2:47
becoming itself are intrinsically good
2:50
and that it's incumbent upon us to act
2:53
in accordance with that dicum come hell
2:56
or high
2:58
water and we look into the future and we
3:02
cast upon the unknown landscape of the
3:05
future a vision a a vision that provides
3:09
us with hope and security because that's
3:11
what a vision does and then we bear the
3:14
responsibility of attending and acting
3:17
in a manner that makes that hopeful and
3:22
security providing Vision possible and
3:27
so then I would
3:28
say that
3:30
identity is the proper Union of faith
3:34
and
3:37
responsibility and then you might
3:39
say how
3:41
does a proper identity unite faith and
3:45
responsibility and I would say that it
3:48
does that in a subsidiary manner in a
3:51
hierarchical subsidiary manner now if
3:55
you're beset with conflict subjectively
3:59
and your Society about what identity
4:01
constitutes you need a counter position
4:04
that's welldeveloped
4:06
so identity is the proper Union of faith
4:09
and responsibility and proper identity
4:13
is subsidiary in structure all right so
4:15
let's take that apart first
4:23
slide now I'm going to tell you a little
4:25
story it's a very simple story but
4:29
Simple Story scale upward and that's
4:32
Jacob's Ladder Jacob's Ladder that's the
4:34
Eternal lyan the vine that unites the
4:39
material and proximal Realm of the Earth
4:41
with the Eternal Realm Of
4:45
Heaven how do we construct and climb
4:48
Jacob's Ladder how do we comprehend it
4:51
when my son was one and a half years
4:56
old I taught him to set the table
5:00
but that's not right because when you're
5:02
one and a half you can't set the
5:05
table if you take a two-year-old and you
5:08
say clean your
5:09
room to a 2-year-old who's in the midst
5:12
of a room that he's distributed a
5:14
terrible mess in and you come back in 15
5:16
minutes the room will be equally messy
5:19
and you'll ask your 2-year-old why
5:21
didn't you clean the room and he will
5:23
just look at you and the reason he will
5:26
just look at you is because he doesn't
5:27
know what clean your room
5:30
means so you can take the 2-year-old my
5:33
son in this case and you can say Hey
5:38
kid you see that teddy bear now he's
5:41
happy about that request hey because at
5:44
two he knows how to see a teddy bear and
5:47
so he'll Point his eyes at the teddy
5:49
bear and then he'll look at you and then
5:51
you can Pat him on the head and say good
5:54
and then you can
5:55
say go over there and pick up that teddy
5:57
bear so that he does that that and he
5:59
looks at you and then you can say you
6:01
see that space on the Shelf there he
6:04
goes yes he say you take that teddy bear
6:07
and you put it in that space in the
6:09
shelf and he'll go over and put it in
6:12
the space in the shelf and then he'll
6:13
look at you and you can Pat him on the
6:15
head and then if you teach him a 100
6:17
micro routines like that very carefully
6:20
you can tell him to clean his room and
6:22
he knows how to do it and that's how we
6:24
build ourselves and that's a little
6:26
vision it's a little vision you it's a
6:28
micro Vision that
6:31
the first vision is what the room would
6:34
look like if the teddy bear was put in
6:36
its proper space right it's not a
6:40
glorious macro vision of how to unite
6:42
Heaven and Earth itself but it's the
6:45
proximal beginnings of exactly that
6:47
process
6:49
so we scaffold ourselves upward from the
6:52
finite to the infinite and it's the
6:55
entire scaffold that constitutes our
6:57
identity
6:58
so my son he's 18 months old I'm having
7:01
him help set the table I say
7:05
kid you know where the drawer is with
7:08
the knives and the forks and he says yes
7:10
I said go to that
7:12
drawer and open it up and pick out a
7:15
fork and so he goes and does that he can
7:17
feel the fork because he has the drawers
7:20
above him and he can feel the fork and
7:21
then he can come and say bring it into
7:23
the kitchen and put it on the table by
7:26
the plate and he can do that and then he
7:28
can do that with a kn
7:29
and then he can do that with a plate if
7:31
you dare to let him carry a plate and
7:34
then he's learning
7:36
what he's learning to set the
7:39
table right and then he sits at the
7:41
table with the people that are there and
7:43
he's learning to share food and he's
7:46
learning to take turns and he's learning
7:48
to be hospitable right and so you can
7:51
see that that starts to scale upward
7:53
right and then he's hospitable and he
7:55
can take turns so he's starting to be a
7:56
good boy a good kid and that's that's
7:59
part of being taking his proper role in
8:02
the family which is a broader form of
8:05
sharing and the beginnings of his
8:07
ability to play properly with others and
8:10
then to take his position as a potential
8:14
friend in the community and then to
8:16
mature and as he matures the scale of
8:19
his vision expands step by step until it
8:24
encompasses not merely what he wants in
8:27
the short term but what would be good
8:28
for him in the medium to long term so
8:31
the temporal scale of his vision expands
8:35
and not only so that he accomplishes or
8:39
attains what's good for him but so that
8:41
he does that in a way that incorporates
8:43
more and more other people into the
8:45
expansive as vision and so by the time
8:47
you start to operate as an adult you can
8:50
take responsibility for yourself you
8:52
know how to be hospitable you know how
8:54
to play with others if you're fortunate
8:56
or maybe you still have to learn that
8:58
within the confines of your marriage and
9:00
then you take responsibility for your
9:02
partner and they do that with you and
9:04
the two of you take responsibility for
9:06
your children and that gives you the
9:09
satisfaction and the adventure and the
9:11
responsibility and the burden and the
9:13
meaning of your family and you embed
9:15
that in your community and you take
9:17
responsibility for that and you take
9:19
responsibility beyond that for your town
9:22
and for your city and for your state and
9:24
you do that all in as balanced and
9:27
harmonious a manner as you can man and
9:30
the spirit that sub the spirit that
9:33
infuses that entire hierarchy and that
9:36
stands at the top is something like the
9:39
spirit of goodness itself and that's
9:42
classically associated with what is
9:44
highest and that's traditionally
9:46
associated with God and the identity
9:49
that you have is all of that stretching
9:52
from lowest to highest at once and
9:55
having understood that you now
9:58
understand something else
9:59
you understand what actually constitutes
10:02
genuine human flourishing at the
10:04
psychological level so one of the
10:06
disservices that clinicians have offered
10:10
the general Western world and the world
10:14
at large as a consequence of that is the
10:16
notion that mental health is somehow
10:19
something subjective and that's not true
10:23
and we know it's not true even though we
10:25
don't know that we know it and you know
10:27
that because there's no way you're going
10:29
to be mentally healthy if your wife is
10:32
miserable first of all she won't let you
10:37
be
10:38
and the same thing applies to your
10:41
children one of my neighbors in Toronto
10:43
said to me once a mother is never any
10:45
happier than her most miserable child
10:48
right and that's and so you can see in
10:50
that that whatever mental health
10:52
constitutes it's not exactly mental and
10:54
it's certainly not merely subjective it
10:56
has it's something that's much more like
10:58
the Harmony that exists when the entire
11:01
subsidiary structure is performing all
11:04
of its functions as they should be
11:06
performed now Samuel talked about Samuel
11:09
andreev just before me talked about what
11:11
music speaks to us and that's what music
11:14
speaks to us it speaks to us of the
11:16
harmony that can exist in a complex
11:19
structure that's laid out in a properly
11:21
subsidiary manner where each note serves
11:24
the phrase and each phrase serves the
11:25
melody and each person who's playing in
11:27
the orchestra serves the overarching
11:29
function of the music and the music is
11:32
the Eternal dance between Chaos and
11:34
Order and that speaks to us of meaning
11:37
because that's where meaning is to be
11:39
found and that's the other thing to
11:41
understand about a subsidiary
11:42
organization you know we have so many
11:45
people in the world who are lost in ways
11:48
that are almost unimaginable with their
11:51
absolutely fragmented identities and
11:53
they have no meaning in their life and
11:55
they have no meaning in their life
11:56
because strangely enough the meaning me
11:59
in your life doesn't emerge as a
12:01
consequence of your pursuit of your
12:04
proximal hedonic subjective narrow
12:07
purely self-serving goals and drives
12:11
there's nothing in that that's
12:12
nourishing and there's nothing in that
12:14
that's nourishing in part because unless
12:16
you can integrate yourself across a
12:19
large time span taking care of who you
12:21
will be in the future and simultaneously
12:24
fulfilling your social obligations in a
12:26
responsible manner the none none of the
12:29
nothing within the subsidiary structure
12:31
can operate properly much less you claim
12:35
the right to the gratification of your
12:37
hedonic desires that's a non-starter and
12:40
even if you could do that you wouldn't
12:41
find in that the meaning that would
12:43
sustain you in times of trouble you find
12:45
the meaning that and everyone knows this
12:48
you find the meaning that sustains you
12:50
in trouble when you need for example to
12:53
regard yourself with some some positive
12:55
attitude in the midst of your stupidity
12:57
and your suffering and you can see in
12:59
yourself the fact that well at least you
13:01
were in service to your wife at least
13:03
you had been useful to your children at
13:05
least you helped take care of your
13:07
parents at least you were of some
13:09
service to your friends or to your
13:10
customers to your business associates to
13:13
your nation you find that meaning in
13:16
service and that service is in service
13:18
of that Harmony that makes up the entire
13:21
Jacob's Ladder that stretches from Earth
13:24
to heaven and it's always been that way
13:27
and we offer our children thin grool as
13:29
a replacement for that magnificent
13:32
version of multi-dimensional Harmony
13:35
responsibility and beauty and there's
13:37
more to it than that too you know I read
13:40
the book The this the the biblical book
13:44
that details out the life of Abraham and
13:47
I mentioned this when the conference
13:49
opened Abraham begins his life with all
13:52
his proximal hedonic needs satiated and
13:57
the voice of God comes to him and says
13:58
says go out into the world get away from
14:01
what's merely infantile and satiating
14:04
and have the adventure of your life and
14:06
that's a good bargain because we're
14:08
built not for mere proximal infantile
14:13
satiation of our based desires but to
14:16
move out into the world like the
14:18
adventurers that we are and to face the
14:20
complexities of the catastrophic future
14:23
with a certain degree of nobility and
14:25
courage and to Hoist the world on our
14:27
shoulders and to struggle uphill and
14:30
it's in that struggle that the meaning
14:32
of life emerges if you lived your life
14:35
completely maybe it would justify itself
14:39
right if you could and where would you
14:41
find the meaning that justifies the
14:42
suffering in life and the answer to that
14:44
is well you find it in the burden of
14:46
responsibility because the burden of
14:48
responsibility isn't a burden it's the
14:50
greatest opportunity you could possibly
14:53
have and you know perfectly well when
14:55
you're trying to decide if your own life
14:57
is worth having this that if someone
14:59
comes up to you even once and says you
15:01
know what you did for me it really
15:04
mattered and that might get you through
15:05
like a week of rough times just the mere
15:08
fact that it was obvious that the
15:10
sacrifices that you made in relationship
15:13
to others actually made a difference and
15:15
you can make a continual difference in
15:17
your life if you adopt the proper
15:19
sacrificial attitude right and it's the
15:22
sacrificial attitude that makes the
15:25
hierarchy of identity possible because
15:28
what you do with the proper sacrifices
15:30
continually sacrifice the lower to the
15:33
higher you continually you sacrifice
15:36
your own meat self-serving proximal
15:40
hedonic whims to a pattern of being that
15:42
sustains you across the long run and
15:45
that unites more and more people and
15:47
it's a worthwhile sacrifice because the
15:50
payback for the sacrifice
15:52
overwhelmingly what would you say is
15:54
overwhelmingly disproportionate to the
15:56
cost and everyone who's had a a child
15:59
who has any sense who's escaped from
16:02
their primordial narcissism understands
16:04
this because bringing a child into the
16:07
world and watching that person develop
16:09
is a Bittersweet Adventure because
16:12
children are fragile and things go wrong
16:14
but it's a very rare person whose head
16:16
is set on their shoulders in anything
16:18
approximating the proper manner who
16:20
isn't thrilled to death to see the
16:23
person they brought into the world
16:25
Thrive as a consequence of their
16:26
sacrifices and to see in that thriving
16:29
the justification for all the pain that
16:31
was associated with their
16:34
production and so and that's what life
16:36
is like and we don't let young people
16:38
know this anymore you know here's
16:40
something psychologists discovered in
16:43
the last 20 years there is no technical
16:47
difference between thinking about
16:52
yourself and being
16:54
miserable those are the same thing and
16:57
you know that too too you know if I'm on
17:00
stage and I'm talking to you and all of
17:03
a sudden I become self-conscious I drown
17:06
an anxiety and I lose my place right and
17:09
that's what's happening to the young
17:10
people that we see who are a drift
17:12
they're taught to be nothing but
17:13
self-conscious to do nothing but think
17:16
about their immediate needs to refer to
17:19
themselves as the Locust of all things
17:21
and there's nothing you could do that
17:23
would make them more miserable it's
17:25
identical with the instruction in misery
17:29
and you want to be outside yourself
17:31
serving a higher purpose and maybe
17:33
you're cynical about that but you can
17:36
think about it technically well why do
17:38
you bring a fork to the table well so
17:40
that you can put a plate beside it and
17:42
why do you put a plate at the table and
17:45
so that you can set the table to serve
17:47
your family to share food to bring
17:49
together the people you love in
17:51
something approximating Harmony as a
17:54
microcosm of the entire Cosmic order and
17:58
you can replicate that at every level of
18:00
complexity all the way up to what's at
18:02
the Pinnacle and that's all real and so
18:06
is what's at the Pinnacle and we've
18:08
forgotten all of that and as a
18:11
consequence of forgetting that we've
18:12
forgotten the responsibility that we
18:15
need to bear in our life to make our
18:17
lives bearable and we've forgotten the
18:20
meaning and the adventure and the
18:21
purpose and the significance and this
18:24
and the earned self-regard that goes
18:27
along with that sacrifice attitude and
18:29
we've forgotten to tell our children the
18:31
same thing and we could remember we
18:34
could remember who we are we could
18:37
remember who we are and that's what this
18:41
conference was for to remind people
18:44
everyone who attends who you are right
18:47
you're the the
18:57
the
19:00
you're you're the men and women
19:02
individuals made in the image of God who
19:04
stumble eternally uphill towards the the
19:08
the Jerusalem on the hill the The
19:10
Shining City on the hill you know and
19:12
we're so foolish we regard those
19:15
propositions as something approximating
19:18
what primitive superstitions when in
19:20
fact they're the most brilliant
19:22
intuitions into the fundamental
19:23
structure of reality that have ever been
19:25
offered we've predicated our
19:27
civilization on those presuppositions
19:30
and look at it it's not so bad we've
19:32
brought wealth and plenty to billions of
19:35
people around the world we've been
19:37
struggling uphill properly and if we
19:38
were wise and faithful and courageous
19:42
and responsible we could continue to
19:44
spread that to everyone we could
19:45
eradicate absolute poverty we could
19:48
bring about uh time of abundance and
19:51
opportunity for everyone and we'll do
19:53
that we can do that if we Hoist the
19:55
world on our individual shoulders and
19:58
operate collectively in this harmonious
20:01
Manner and continue the struggle uphill
20:03
toward the city of God and that's the
20:05
truth that's the truth it's not some
20:08
Superstition it's not some
20:10
primitive defense against death anxiety
20:14
it's not the opiate of the people right
20:16
it's the call to Divine responsibility
20:18
and to the degree that each of us acted
20:21
out in the confines of our own life we
20:23
do what I suggested at the beginning of
20:25
this conference which is tilt the world
20:27
to towards heaven and away from hell and
20:30
we're put this conference together to
20:33
encourage people to do exactly that in
20:36
the belief that it is in fact the people
20:39
who can do exactly that not only can but
20:41
must any attempt to circumvent that
20:45
responsibility merely brings about some
20:48
what would you say oscillating tension
20:51
between absolute tyranny and utter
20:53
slavery right as a responsible citizen
20:57
bearing the weight of the world world on
20:58
your shoulders you obliviate the
21:00
necessity for the Tyrant and the slave
21:02
and so that's what we want to do and
21:04
that's what we encourage all of you to
21:06
do and to leave this coner conference
21:10
thinking deeply about what it is that
21:12
you could offer to the world if you
21:14
threw everything that you had into it
21:16
because life is a very difficult
21:18
proposition and you're not going to be
21:21
the Glorious success that you could be
21:23
unless you throw yourself into it
21:25
utterly wholeheartedly accepting in all
21:28
its terrible expans of catastrophe and
21:31
possibility and realizing in yourself
21:33
the person who has that Divine
21:35
responsibility along with all the rights
21:37
that are attended upon that to set the
21:40
world straight my sense is that if
21:42
enough of us enough of us realized that
21:46
sufficiently there's nothing we couldn't
21:48
accomplish there's no desert we couldn't
21:50
make Bloom there's no reason for zero
21:53
some malthusian pessimism right we could
21:56
have what we wanted if if we truly
21:59
wanted it if we truly sought for it if
22:01
we truly asked for it it would make
22:03
itself manifest as a consequence of our
22:06
faith and our responsibility the
22:08
adoption of our proper identity and so
22:11
you're invited to do that as the
22:13
individuals the wory individuals that
22:15
you are who were called to this place
22:18
because you had let enough of the light
22:21
inside of you out to shine enough on
22:23
other people so that your value was
22:27
clearly made manifest and we tried to
22:29
gather 1500 people together who had done
22:32
that however imperfectly as we do such
22:35
things imperfectly to encourage them to
22:38
introduce them to other people with the
22:40
same abiding spirit and to see what we
22:42
could do with all the opportunity that
22:45
we have in front of us and so that's the
22:49
hope of
22:52
Ark on that note I would like to call on
22:56
someone to
22:59
remind us in the most appropriate manner
23:03
of what it is that we all have to do
23:06
when we leave
23:15
here
