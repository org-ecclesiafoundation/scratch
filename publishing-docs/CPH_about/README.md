Jonathan D. Schultz was born in Harvard, Illinois, as the third of five children of the Rev. Donald and Mary Schultz. Much of his childhood was spent living in rural Altamont, IL, where his father was pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church (Blue Point). His high school years were spent in Red Bud, Illinois, after his father was called to serve at St. John’s Lutheran Church there.

Mr. Schultz received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Management from Concordia University, River Forest, Illinois and received his law degree from Loyola University of Chicago School of Law.

Prior to arriving at CPH in 1998, he and his wife served as volunteer missionaries in Guatemala for The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod. He has also practiced law at a Chicago law firm.

One of Mr. Schultz’s passions is Lutheran education. He currently serves as Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Lutheran High School Association of St. Louis. From 2003-2014, he held various leadership positions on the Board of Directors of Christ Community Lutheran School, a Presidential Blue Ribbon School serving more than 600 students and their families. Mr. Schultz also currently serves as Chair of the Board of the Lutheran Foundation of St. Louis, a $100 million foundation that is committed in the name of Jesus Christ to seeing the improved care of hurting people in the greater St. Louis region. In addition, from 2007-2018, Mr. Schultz served in various leadership positions on the Board of Directors of Lutheran World Relief, an international relief and development agency. Mr. Schultz is active in his congregation, Glendale Lutheran Church.

In 1990, Mr. Schultz married Susan Wischmeier, a Lutheran school teacher, who grew up on her family’s farm outside of Columbus, Indiana. The Lord has blessed them with three children, Thomas (and wife, Allison), Mollie, and Abigail. They currently reside in St. Louis, Missouri.
